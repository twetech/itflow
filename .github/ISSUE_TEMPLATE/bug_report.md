We're now using GitHub Issues exclusively for development.
-

Going forward, GitHub Issues will be used to track confirmed bugs & planned features via Github Projects. This allows us to keep GitHub clean & tidy, whilst maintaining an active and relaxed community experience on the Forum.

Please raise bugs on the forum @ https://forum.itflow.org/t/bug. Make sure to mention whether you can replicate the bug on demo.itflow.org. 

Thanks,

The ITFlow team :)
