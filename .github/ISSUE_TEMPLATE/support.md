We're now using GitHub Issues exclusively for development.
-

Going forward, GitHub Issues will be used to track confirmed bugs & planned features via Github Projects. This allows us to keep GitHub clean & tidy, whilst maintaining an active and relaxed community experience on the Forum.

Please use the forum for support queries/issues: https://forum.itflow.org/t/support

All new support requests raised here will be closed.

Thanks,

The ITFlow team :)
