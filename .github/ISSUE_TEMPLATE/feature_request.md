We're now using GitHub just to track features we're definitely planning to implement (and bugs!).

Please discuss new feature requests on the forum @ https://forum.itflow.org/t/features. This allows us to gather interest & feedback on the features people feel are most important, whilst keeping GitHub cleaner and more about the code.

New feature requests here will be closed.

Thanks :)
