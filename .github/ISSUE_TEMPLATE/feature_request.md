We're now using GitHub Issues exclusively for development.
-

Going forward, GitHub Issues will be used to track confirmed bugs & planned features via Github Projects. This allows us to keep GitHub clean & tidy, whilst maintaining an active and relaxed community experience on the Forum.

Please discuss new feature requests on the forum @ https://forum.itflow.org/t/features. When creating discussions, try to imagine how your proposed feature would also benefit other users.

All new feature requests raised here will be closed, unless agreed otherwise.

Thanks,

The ITFlow team :)
