# Security Policy

## In Beta

ITFlow is currently in early beta and is a work in progress. 
We currently advise against storing confidential data in ITFlow for this reason.

That said, in order to eventually be useful, ITFlow **must** be secure and take security seriously.
We attempt to follow security best practices where possible, including [automated code scanning](https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=itflow-org_itflow&metric=security_rating&view=list).

## Supported Versions

ITFlow is in Beta. 

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you have discovered a security issue, please report it to us in as much detail as possible so we can fix it. 
You should expect to receive an initial acknowledgement within 72 hours. If you do not, please get in touch discretely via GitHub issues/Forum/Discord to ensure we received your e-mail.
