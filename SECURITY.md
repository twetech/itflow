# Security Policy

## **Please do NOT report security concerns/vulnerabilities publicly (Github issues/forum)**

---

## In Beta

ITFlow is currently in beta and is a work in progress. 

**We take security seriously.** Whilst we are confident the code is safe, nothing in life is 100% safe or risk-free. You should use your best judgment before entering confidential information into the app.

We attempt to follow security best practices where possible, including [automated code scanning](https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=itflow-org_itflow&metric=security_rating&view=list).

## Reporting a Vulnerability via GitHub Security Advisories

**Security contact: [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/itflow-org/itflow/security/advisories/new)**

If you have discovered a security issue, please **[report it](https://github.com/itflow-org/itflow/security/advisories/new)** to us in as much detail as possible, so we can fix it. 

You should expect to receive an initial acknowledgement within 72 hours. If you don't receive any feedback, we may have missed the initial email from GitHub (we're human!). Please raise a private forum discussion with johnny and wrongecho quoting ONLY the assigned GHSA ref.
